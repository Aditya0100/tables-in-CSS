some beautiful table colors and ideas! and how to make tables responsive!
## Project Overview
This small project will teach how what tricks you should use to make tables responsive!
### Things to note!!!
So in order to make tables responsive! there are `2` ways!
1. Use CSS property `overflow-x: auto;` so that when resolution of broswer is decreased then over flow property helps to wrap up ur table! It's easy and most used way!

2. Use relative units and **media queries** to make tables responsive! This method is too long and time consuming! So, I prefer you should go for 1st method!
